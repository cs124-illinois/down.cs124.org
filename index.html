        <h1>Campus Network Outage: CS 124 Affected</h1>
        <p>
          CS 124 servers are affected by the ongoing <a
          target="_blank" href="https://status.illinois.edu/incidents/561124">campus network
          outage</a>.
          Our email tools and forum are also disabled, limiting our ability to
          communicate about the problem.
          We're using <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2h57pzxc">this Google Doc</a>
          to share updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point it's unclear when the situation will be resolved.
          The campus network remains unstable and the problem seems serious.
          At minimum we'll be taking the following steps:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>This week's initial homework deadline of Tuesday 1/30/2024 will
              be extended.</li>
            <li>Quiz 2 will be extended through Wednesday 1/31/2024.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for your patience.
          Note that CS 124 staff has no control over core university networking infrastructure,
          and emailing us will not address the problem.
          We'll be working to bring our sites online as soon as the network is
          up again.
